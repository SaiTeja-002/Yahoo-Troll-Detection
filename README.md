# Yahoo-Troll-Detection

### Task Description

As a last-ditch attempt to give Yahoo Answers some legitimacy in the era of Quora and Reddit, Yahoo's CEO Merissa Meyer has tasked you with creating a machine learning model to detect spam and troll questions so that they can be removed. To this end, you are given a hand-labeled dataset consisting of questions with unique IDs and whether they are troll questions or not.
